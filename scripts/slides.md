# Updates on GPCR constraint 
* Paper draft & timeline
* Drug target information
* IMPC phenotyping
* Isoforms
---
# Drug target information
* For up-to-date information extracted approved and investigational drugs from DrugBank
* Slight changes to drug data from Congreve 2019
---
# IMPC phenotyping
* Lethal = 'preweaning lethality'. Allow incomplete/complete penetrance
* Apparent focus on understudied receptors: ~40 orphan receptors, 8 chemokines, few aminergics
* Therefore highly relevant to focus of paper on understudied receptor. Where constraint and orphan receptors agree seems likely that these receptors are of high importance.
---
# Isoforms
* Majority (62%) of GPCRs have only one isoform, and majority of isoforms differ only at C & N terminal truncations
* Therefore expressed non-canonical isoforms are unlikely to have different effects to the canonical
* Might be worth looking at some GPCRs that do show functional alternative splicing e.g. CNR1
